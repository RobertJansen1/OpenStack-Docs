# How to view secrets

To view your secrets, type the following command in the CLI.

``` bash
Downloads % Openstack secret list
```


![Source Download]({{ '/assets/images/keymanager/secret list1.jpeg' | relative_url }})

Due to not having any secrets, it results in an empty command line and then shows the standard line again as soon above.
