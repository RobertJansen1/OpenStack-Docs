# How to view secrets

If you are just starting with this, you most likely will not have any secrets available yet.
To view your secrets, type the following command in the CLI.

_Openstack secret list_


![Source Download]({{ '/assets/images/keymanager/secret list1.jpeg' | relative_url }})

Due to not having any secrets, it results in an empty command line and then shows the standard line again as soon above.
