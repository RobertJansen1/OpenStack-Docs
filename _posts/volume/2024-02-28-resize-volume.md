# Resize a volume

## Introduction
Volumes are a great way to store data for your instances. However, sometimes
you may need to resize a volume to add more space. This article will guide you
through the process of resizing a volume within OpenStack and resizing the
filesystem within the instance (server).

## Using the OpenStack Dashboard
To resize a volume using the OpenStack Dashboard, please follow these steps:  
**Step 1**  
First log in to the OpenStack Dashboard

**Step 2**  
Navigate to the `Volumes` section

**Step 3**  
Click on the volume you want to resize

**Step 4**  
Click on the `Small Arrow` button behind the volume and click `Extend Volume`

**Step 5**  
Enter the new size of the volume and click `Extend Volume`

Your volume is now be resized within OpenStack. Please note that you may need
to extend your filesystem within the instance (server) as well before you are
able to use the new space. To do this please proceed to the section: 
[Resize filesystem within the instance](#resize-filesystem-within-the-instance)

---

## Using the OpenStack CLI
To resize a volume using the OpenStack CLI, please follow these steps:

**Step 1**  
First make sure you have setup the OpenStack CLI and that you are able to
execute commands using the `openstack` command. For more information please
refer to the
[Using the OpenStack CLI article](
    {{ '/articles/using-the-cli-linux' | relative_url }}
).

**Step 2**  
Identitfy the volume you want to resize we do this by listing the volumes
```bash
openstack volume list
```

**Step 3**  
If the volume is attached to an instance, you will need to detach the volume
before you can resize it. You can do this using the following command
```bash
openstack server remove volume <server-name-or-id> <volume-name-or-id>
```
**Step 4**  
Run the following command to resize the volume
```bash
openstack volume set --size <new-size-in-gb> <volume-id-or-name>
```
**Step 5**  
Now we need to re-attach the volume to the instance
```bash
openstack server add volume <server-name-or-id> <volume-name-or-id>
```

Your volume is now be resized within OpenStack. Please note that you may need
to extend your filesystem within the instance (server) as well before you are
able to use the new space. To do this please proceed to the section: 
[Resize filesystem within the instance](#resize-filesystem-within-the-instance)

## Resize filesystem within the instance

For both Linux and Windows, you will need to resize the filesystem within the
instance (server) as well.

[Instructions for Linux](#linux)

[Instructions for Windows](#windows)

### Linux
After resizing the volume within OpenStack, you will need to resize the
filesystem within the instance (server) as well. 

**Step 1**  
First we need to identify the volume. This can be done using the `lsblk` command.
```bash
lsblk
```

**Step 2**  
_The folowing step is only required if you have partitions on the volume._  
If you have partitions on the volume, you will need to resize the partition
before resizing the filesystem. This can be done using the `growpart` command.
```bash
sudo growpart <disk> <partion_number>
```
**Step 3**  
After you will need to resize the filesystem. This can be done using
the `resize2fs` command.
```bash
resize2fs <disk/partition>
```

### Windows
After resizing the volume within OpenStack, you will need to resize the
filesystem within the instance (server) as well. We recommend using the
documentation provided by Microsoft to [resize the filesystem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/disk-management/extend-a-basic-volume).

[Instruction for resizing using Disk Management](#using-disk-management)

[Instruction for resizing using PowerShell](#using-powershell)

#### Using Disk Management

Right-click the windows logo in the left bottom corner and click
on `Disk Management`.  
<img class="rounded border border-dark" src="{{ '/assets/images/2024-02-28-resize-volume/2024-02-28-open-diskmanagement.png' | relative_url }}" width="auto" height="400" />

Right-click the volume you want to resize and click `Extend Volume`.  
<img class="rounded border border-dark" src="{{ '/assets/images/2024-02-28-resize-volume/2024-02-28-diskmanagement.png' | relative_url }}" width="auto" height="500" />

Follow the wizard to extend the volume and click `Finish` to complete the
process.
> If you want to use all of the available space, you can just click `Next` and
then `Finish` in the wizard.

#### Using PowerShell
To resize the filesystem using PowerShell, you can use the `Resize-Partition`
cmdlet. The Powershell script below will resize the partition to the maximum
size. Replace `<drive_letter>` with the drive letter of the partition you want
to resize.
```powershell
# Set the drive/partition you want to resize
$TargetDrive = "<drive_letter>"

# Get the maximum size of the partition
$DriveSize = (Get-PartitionSupportedSize -DriveLetter $TargetDrive)

# Resize the partition
Resize-Partition -DriveLetter $TargetDrive -Size $DriveSize.SizeMax
```
